/**
 * Single source of truth for the Step 2 table's filter logic.
 *
 * Extracted out of SubtitleTable so BulkEditBar can compute the same
 * "currently visible" id list (needed for its hidden-selection count and
 * for Shift+click range selection) without duplicating the rules.  Any
 * future tab is added in one place and both consumers stay in sync.
 *
 * REQ-103 rewrite — the table now uses the spec's two-group tab model:
 *
 *   行き先 (mutually exclusive, count-conservation holds):
 *     'all'     = everything (normal + edited + manuallyDeleted + trimDeleted)
 *     'ready'   = normal + edited       (= !effectivelyDeleted)
 *     'deleted' = manuallyDeleted + trimDeleted (= effectivelyDeleted)
 *
 *     ⇒  filterEntries('ready') + filterEntries('deleted')
 *        === filterEntries('all') for every entries/cuts pair.
 *
 *   フィルタ (cross-cutting, may include deleted rows):
 *     'edited'   = wasEdited        (manual edit OR cut clamp)
 *     'warnings' = hasAnyWarning(w) (any non-empty-text warning)
 *
 *   The cross-cutting filters DO NOT exclude `effectivelyDeleted` rows
 *   because REQ-103 §B explicitly wants 編集済み to surface deleted
 *   rows that were once edited (= "削除済みでも出力対象でも、編集
 *   されていれば表示").  The timeline view applies its own additional
 *   `!effectivelyDeleted` filter on top so deleted rows never render
 *   as blocks even when the user is on 編集済み / 警告.
 *
 *   `warnings` no longer requires `!w.emptyText` to surface the row —
 *   that error is still excluded from the export filter in
 *   step2.tsx:getOutputEntries (= the row appears in the 警告 tab so
 *   the user can fix it).
